Once upon a time there was a man who lived in Venezuela. This man loved to read books and listen to music in his apartment. The man had not been able to find a job for years after getting fired at his previous employment insitution, a life insurance firm. All he wished for was to be able to retire on the beach and watch the surfers as he lounged with a book and ice cold Mr. Pibb soda. He had once had a wife but had mutually decided to separate as the love had been lost for years. However that was over 15 years ago and loneliness had crept up on him over many years of serene isolation. This quiet life was brought to an abrupt halt when, one day, his apartment was raided by local police with no reason at all. (idk what they meant by a story lol just kinda wrote this...)
